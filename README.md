# Eat-da-burger!

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, and devour the created burgers. 

In this assignment, I used MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM all while using following the MVC design pattern.

Onload, Burgers are displayed in two columns: 

** Burgers Available ** && ** Burgers Eaten **

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page with the other burgers that have been devoured. 

The app will store all burgers using MySQL. Enjoy!
